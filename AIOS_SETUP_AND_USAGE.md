# AIOS Setup and Usage Instructions

## Introduction
This document provides instructions for setting up, configuring, and using the Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS). The AIOS is designed to automate tasks based on given prompts, search the web using browsers like Google Chrome or Edge, update and code itself, and maintain user confidentiality.

## Prerequisites
- A machine with x86 architecture
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS installed
- Internet connection

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Install Essential Tools and Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git curl python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. **Clone the Latest Stable Linux Kernel:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git
   cd linux
   git checkout v6.9.3
   ```

3. **Install AI Tools in a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv aios_venv
   source aios_venv/bin/activate
   pip install tensorflow torch transformers jupyter pandas scikit-learn nltk spacy
   deactivate
   ```

## Configuring the X Server
1. **Install Xorg and Xvfb:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y xorg xvfb
   ```

2. **Start the Xvfb Server:**
   ```bash
   Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1600x1000x24 -nolisten tcp -auth /tmp/xvfb-run.CAVi8T/Xauthority &
   export DISPLAY=:99
   ```

3. **Configure X Server to Allow Local Connections:**
   ```bash
   export XAUTHORITY=/tmp/xvfb-run.CAVi8T/Xauthority
   xhost +local:
   ```

## Using the AIOS Automation Scripts
1. **aios_llm_automation.sh:**
   This script automates tasks using a compressed language model. It takes a command as an argument, generates a response using the language model, validates that the response is a valid shell command, and then executes it.

   **Example Usage:**
   ```bash
   ./aios_llm_automation.sh "echo Test LLM automation"
   ```

2. **aios_task_automation.sh:**
   This script automates tasks based on given prompts. It can detect the available browser and perform web searches.

   **Example Usage:**
   ```bash
   ./aios_task_automation.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- **X Server Authorization Issues:**
  If you encounter authorization issues with the X server, ensure that the `XAUTHORITY` environment variable is set correctly and that the `xhost` command is used to allow local connections.

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  export XAUTHORITY=/tmp/xvfb-run.CAVi8T/Xauthority
  xhost +local:
  ```

- **GPU Process Errors:**
  If you encounter errors related to the GPU process when running GUI applications, try running the application in headless mode or ensure that your environment has proper GPU support.

## Testing the AIOS
To test the AIOS for functionality and performance, perform a series of actions that simulate typical user interactions with the system. This includes executing commands through the `aios_llm_automation.sh` script, performing web searches, and opening GUI applications.

**Example Test:**
```bash
./aios_llm_automation.sh "google-chrome --no-sandbox https://www.google.com"
```

## Conclusion
By following these instructions, you should be able to set up, configure, and use the AIOS effectively. If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance.
